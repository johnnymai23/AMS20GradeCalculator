Project Description: In my AMS20 Linear Algebra class, our overall grade was based on
the highest of the following FOUR options below. I've created a program to calculate
which option provides them the highest final grade based off their 3 midterm scores
and final score.

Option 1: Midterm Exam 1 (15%), Midterm Exam 2 (15%), Midterm Exam 3 (15%), Final Exam (55%)
Option 2: Midterm Exam 1 (25%), Midterm Exam 2 (25%), Midterm Exam 3 (25%), Final Exam (25%)
Option 3: Final Exam (100%)
Option 4: The average of the three midterm exams if the average score of the three midterm exams is higher than or equal to 75%.
